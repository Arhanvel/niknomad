# Further Ideas
- Add a status column to the posts table to allow for posts that are still in a "draft" state. Only when this status is changed to "published" should they show up in the blog feed.
- Update the "Edit Post" page in the admin section to allow for changing the author of a post.
- Add an RSS feed that lists all posts in chronological order.
- Record/Track and display the "views_count" for each post.
- Allow registered users to "bookmark" certain posts that they enjoyed. Then display their bookmarks in a corresponding settings page.
- Add an account page to update your username and upload an avatar for your profile.
- Add feature to view all your comments on account page
